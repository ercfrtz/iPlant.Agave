# iPlant.Agave

These are Perl scripts that I have created in order to facilitate using the Agave API at iPlant, specifically for the variant calling pipeline that has been set up there. This pipeline utilizes
BWA, Samtools, Picard, GATK, and Platypus as software in order to align read data to a reference and call variants from that data.
